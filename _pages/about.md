I'm a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at New York University, advised by Professor Justin Cappos, where I lead research at the Secure Systems Laboratory. My work focuses on Lind, a single-process virtualization environment that emulates a multi-process operating system to improve the security and performance of legacy applications.

My broader research interests include systems security, sandboxing, operating systems, software fault isolation, unikernels, and embedded systems. At the SSL, I lead a research team and mentor a diverse group of graduate and undergraduate students. 

Before coming to NYU, I worked on the DetTrace project at the University of Pennsylvania under Prof. Joseph Devietti, developing tools to enforce reproducibility and determinism in containerized environmentsâ€”research that was published at ASPLOS.
